title: Traffic Sign Classification with a Convolutional Neural Network
permalink: /Signs/
---

The goal of this project was to train a CNN to identify images of German street signs from the LeNet data set. It is important to note that the data is not even distributed among categories. See the chart below:

The CNN I used to train this model is based on. 

This model trained with validation accuracy of 93.5%.
