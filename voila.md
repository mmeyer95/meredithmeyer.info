The motivation for this project path came from a shared group interest in personal health and happiness. As busy individuals with many smartphone apps and notifications, we all envisioned a way to make health tracking both simpler and more insightful.

Our dream for this project was to make the technology seem as amiable as possible. One of the ways we sought to do this is by using smooth edges- circles rather than rectangles- in the overall design. We were limited in budget and supplies, so we adapted a rectangular screen to become multiple circular screens.

The final device was created through myriad cycles of 3D printing pieces. The hardware includes a Pico Pro microcontroller and screen, accelerometer, LED strip, motion sensor, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection.
