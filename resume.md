# Mission

<b>Product Development & Software Engineer</b> | Developing self-driving system, software and hardware architecture for high performance autonomous vehicle applications and real-time computing systems that meet safety and performance goals

# Skills

* Supporting the development of autonomous tools, motion planning and decision-making systems that prevent, detect, and diagnose problems in autonomous cars, ensuring the vehicles and the people in them are always safe
*	Building software tools using C++ and Python to help diagnose vehicle health problems, conducting system configurations and data collection, then displaying that data for system operators in Linux and Unix environments
*	Managing projects and the transfer of product designs to production environments, and ensuring that the organization develops high quality, market ready products, and delivers them in a timely and on-budget manner.
*	Performing vehicle testing for Automated Driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, as well as analyzing data, documenting results, quantifying and reporting outcomes to customer groups and various international sites
*	Guiding cross-functional programs and facilitating conversations with vendors and suppliers that support core planning and control algorithms such as routing, behavior planning, trajectory planning, and feedback controllers

# Experience

### Moog Animatics, Mountain View, CA [August 2018 – Present]
We are the pioneer and recognized leader of integrated motion controls. Since 1987, we’ve been designing and delivering smart motion control products as well as automation solutions for semiconductor, automotive and aerospace industries
<b>Software Development & Applications Engineer</b>, I’m responsible for supporting the development, commissioning, and troubleshooting of our smart machines as well as identifying and communicating product improvement ideas and insights

*	Successfully programmed SmartMotor robotics and motion control software applications in AniBasic and Python, leading to delivery of high-performance motion controls in areas such as automotive test and simulation
*	Provided technical leadership in troubleshooting industrial communication networks: CANopen, DeviceNet, Ethernet/IP as well as architecture design, hands-on verification, and benchmarking of deployed systems on site
*	Conducted hands-on research and data analysis to select motors, drives, and actuators for autonomous systems based on requested parameters from multiple clients and applications with hardware and software components
*	Efficiently built product demos to help our business development and sales team during technology exhibitions, and trained distributors bi-monthly on operation and features of SmartMotor products and proprietary software
*	Coordinated software development programs by facilitating conversations with technology vendors, managing equipment and part suppliers, while working closely with the product development, sales and marketing teams

### [Udacity – Nanodegree Program [2018 – 2019]](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/udacity-printer/production/syllabus/syllabus-nd013-2.0.0-en-us.pdf) 
<b>Self-Driving Car Engineer</b>, I was responsible for applying computer vision and deep learning to automotive problems such as detecting lane lines and predicting steering angles, while studying sensor fusion, localization, planning and PID controls
* Autonomous Highway Driving –	Utilized Sensor Fusion data to predict location of neighboring cars to 0.02 seconds 
* Sensor Fusion Using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) – Applied an EKF to data from Lidar and Radar sensors’ signals
* Autonomous Vehicle Localization with Particle Filter – Localized car on map within 0.15m RMSE for over 1 minute 
* Road Lane Finding – Successfully performed Camera Calibration using checkerboard images and OpenCV in Python 

# Education
