Below is a high-level overview of many of the project I have worked on recently. For more information, visit my GitHub profile, or contact me directly (see footer).

## Lane Finding
#### Skills: Computer Vision, OpenCV, Python, Jupyter Notebooks

Using Canny edge detection for a grayscale image, followed by a Hough Line Transform, I was able to identify lane lines on images captured from a vehicle dash.

## Advanced Lane Finding
#### Skills: Computer Vision, OpenCV, Python, Camera Calibration, Video Processing, Jupyter Notebooks

This project focused on more advanced image manipulation in order to calculate the lane curvature and vehicle positioning within the lane. For real video footage captured from a vehicle's dash, I applied steps of:
1. Undistorting each image
2. Applying a binary threshold
3. Compute a perspective transform (to birds' eye view)
4. Detecting the lane lines
5. Calculating lane curvature and offset
6. Visualizing the lanes and curvature information on top of the video

## Street Sign Classification
#### Skills: Computer Vision, Neural Networks, CNNs, Deep Learning, Python, Jupyter Notebooks 

## Autonomous Driving
#### Skills: Collecting training data, Deep Learning, CNNs, C++

## Kalman Filters
#### Skills: Kalman Filters, Sensor Fusion, C++
