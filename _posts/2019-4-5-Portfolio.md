Below is a high-level overview of many of the projects I have worked on recently. For more information, follow the 'details' links, visit my GitHub profile, or contact me directly (see footer).

## Lane Finding
#### Skills: Computer Vision, OpenCV, Python, Camera Calibration, Video Processing, Jupyter Notebooks

I was able to identify lane lines on video captured from a vehicle dash:

## Autonomous Driving
#### Skills: Collecting training data, Behavioral Cloning, Deep Learning, CNNs, C++

I trained a car simulator to drive on its own using behavioral cloning:

## WorkOutimal: Smart Exercise Bike
#### Skills: Automation, Arduino, Hardware, Sensing, Project Management

A play on the words "workout" and "optimal", WorkOutimal was my Capstone project in the M.Eng. program at UC Berkeley. The goal of the project was to create a cardio machine, in our case a bicycle, that is able to guide the user through an efficient workout. Efficient, for our purposes, means maximum calorie expenditure for a given time. This is possible because power output, which is the product of force and velocity, is a nonlinear function for a human.

For the project, our team decided to change a previously-existing stationary exercise bike. The bike, pictured stripped-down, is a basic Loctek desk bike which uses a magnet and flywheel to manipulate the resistance to pedaling.

As part of the hardware duo, my responsibility is to actually create a working product. We are using a 12 volt linear actuator to manipulate the position of the magnet, and thus the resistance on the bike. I will be using an arduino to gauge the speed of pedalling and also to control the linear actuator. So, the first round of the product will be an add-on item to a stationary bicycle.

The assembly is shown (left). In order to measure the pedal velocity, I created a low-fidelity encoder using a single LED and photoresistor. The gaps in the wheel change the reading on the photoresistor, which I then used to calculate the rotations of the flywheel, and then the rotations of the pedals. Both the velocity measurement system and linear actuator are controlled using an Arduino Uno.

## Text Entry
#### Skills: Java, Android Studio, Laser Cutting, Soldering

As an introduction to Android, I created a low fidelity prototype of a text entry device, including software.
