I am a firm believer in lifelong learning. I'm passionate about being on the cutting edge of new technologies that could better our world.

My personal interests are also driven by the desire to learn and for personal improvement. I am a marathon runner, tennis player, fitness junky, and newly enthusiastic rock climber. I love to travel and try new foods. I'm a dog lover located in the San Francisco Bay Area.
